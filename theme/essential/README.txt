The "Essential" Moodle Theme
============================
![image1](pix/screenshot.jpg "Essential Screenshot")

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gjb2048/moodle-theme_essential.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gjb2048/moodle-theme_essential)

With 2.5 now released Julian thought it time to take the opportunity to build a new theme that would push the new theme engine
to it's limits a bit.  With that in mind he introduced the new "Essential" theme.  Now Julian has left us for Canvassian
adventures, David and Gareth took over development and maintenance.  And now David has left for pastures new, Gareth continues
to maintain and make improvements.

The idea of this theme is to make the site look as little like Moodle as possible. In this specific instance, it would be used
on sites where Moodle would potentially serve as a company homepage rather than just a course list.

Cool things to know about the theme.
 - It attempts to load as many as possible icons from a font
 - Most of what you think are "graphics" are actually the [Awesome font](fontawesome.io)
 - The slider on the front page is completely customisable through theme settings.
 - I am really trying to push what [Bootstrap](twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) Grids can do.  As such the theme is fully
   responsive.
 - The footer is all custom Moodle regions.  This means blocks can be added.
 - The theme can use [Google web fonts](fonts.google.com) to give it that extra bit of shazam!
 - Social network icons appear at the top of the page dynamically based on theme settings.
 - The entire colour scheme can be modified with theme settings.

Required version of Moodle
==========================
This version works with Moodle 3.5 version 2018051700.00 (Build: 20180517) and above within the 3.5 branch until the
next release.

Please ensure that your hardware and software complies with 'Requirements' in 'Installing Moodle' on
'docs.moodle.org/35/en/Installing_Moodle'.

Installation
============
 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the
    theme relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.
 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the
    administrator.
 3. Copy the extracted 'essential' folder to the '/theme/' folder.
 4. Go to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.
 5. Select as the theme for the site.
 6. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Upgrading
=========
 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the
    theme relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.
 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the
    administrator.
 3. Make a backup of your old 'essential' folder in '/theme/' and then delete the folder.
 4. Copy the replacement extracted 'essential' folder to the '/theme/' folder.
 5. Go to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.
 6. If automatic 'Purge all caches' appears not to work by lack of display etc. then perform a manual 'Purge all caches'
    under 'Home -> Site administration -> Development -> Purge all caches'.
 7. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Uninstallation
==============
 1. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
 2. Change the theme to another theme of your choice.
 3. In '/theme/' remove the folder 'essential'.
 4. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Downgrading
===========
If for any reason you wish to downgrade to a previous version of the theme (unsupported) then this procedure will inform you of how
to do so:
1.  Ensure that you have a copy of the existing and older replacement theme files.
2.  Put Moodle into 'Maintenance mode' under 'Home -> Administration -> Site administration -> Server -> Maintenance mode', so that
    there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
3.  Switch to a core theme, 'Clean' for example, under 'Home -> Administration -> Site administration -> Appearance -> Themes ->
    Theme selector -> Default'.
4.  In '/theme/' remove the folder 'essential' i.e. ALL of the contents - this is VITAL.
5.  Put in the replacement 'essential' folder into '/theme/'.
6.  In the database, remove the row with the 'plugin' of 'theme_essential' and 'name' of 'version' in the 'config_plugins' table,
    then in the 'config' table find the 'name' with the value 'allversionhash' and clear its 'value' field.  Perform a
    'Purge all caches' under 'Home -> Site administration -> Development -> Purge all caches'.
7.  Go back in as an administrator and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.  If needed, go to
    'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' if this does not happen.
8.  Switch the theme back to 'Essential' under 'Home -> Administration -> Site administration -> Appearance -> Themes ->
    Theme selector -> Default'.
9.  Put Moodle out of 'Maintenance mode' under 'Home -> Administration -> Site administration -> Server -> Maintenance mode'.

CSlider
=======
The original version of Essential used 'CSlider' - tympanus.net/codrops/2012/03/15/parallax-content-slider-with-css3-and-jquery/.

It has been removed because of licencing issues: github.com/gjb2048/moodle-theme_essential/issues/61

Please do not request that it be put back.  The licence that CSlider has is incompatible with GPLv3 and therefore cannot be a part
of or redistributed with the theme.

Videos and FitVids
==================
Essential uses FitVids.js - fitvidsjs.com - to make embedded videos responsive.  If you do not want this feature for a
particular video, then please add the class 'fitvidsignore' to the video element.

Category course title image in a course
=======================================
If you wish to override the category course title image in a course when this is enabled, then edit the course summary in the course
settings and add an image.  Then edit in HTML mode, remove the surrounding 'p' tags and 'br' tag, then remove the 'style', 'width' and
'height' attributes and any 'classes' added by the text editor on the 'img' tag.  Then add the class 'categorycti'.  To specifiy
the height (px) and the contained title text colour, background colour and opacity, use the following attributes: 'ctih', 'ctit',
'ctib' and ctio respectively, for example:

<img src="mymoodleinstall.mr/pluginfile.php/493/course/section/237/myimage.jpg" alt="Replacement image" class="categorycti"
 ctih="250" ctit="#afafaf" ctib="#222222" ctio="0.5">

This image will not be shown in the summary itself when viewing the list of courses.

Reporting issues
================
Before reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the latest version for your release of Moodle.  It is essential
that you are operating the required version of Moodle as stated at the top - this is because the theme relies on core
functionality that is out of its control.

When reporting an issue you can post in the theme's forum on Moodle.org (currently 'moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=46')
or check the issue list github.com/gjb2048/moodle-theme_essential/issues and if the problem does not exist, create an issue.

It is essential that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the theme's 
'version.php' file.  Other version information such as specific Moodle version, theme name and version also helps.  A screen shot
can be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you consider to be relevant.

History
=======
Please look in CHANGES.txt.
