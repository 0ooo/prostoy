       'rtl' sheet has manual styles.
- FIX: Issue #78.  Category icon issue in RTL.
- FIX: Issue #90.  XML Editor last used.

- NOTE: If you are using an RTL language then please read the instructions in the config.php file to swap to the RTL styles
        manually.  As a code solution to swapping files does not work at the moment and combining all possible CSS into one file
        leads to a big file with lots of redundant CSS.  This presents problems when it comes to portable devices and bandwidth.
